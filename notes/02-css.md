# CSS
em uses window size rather than a specific amount of px for font

Spacing
-Padding # of px determines where padding is added px top, px left, px bottom, px right
-Margin = space around outside of elements, Padding = spacing inside of the elements

vh (view height) is a % of what ever the container size is

Display 
-block; = stack building blocks if siblings 


A tag = link tag with underlines and colored blue

backdrop-filter:blur(2px); =  this can give you a backdrop to text over a picture blur only takes value's in px the more blur you have the more the display behind it shows

when using box-shadow: x axispx, y axispx, blurpx;


@media(max-height:;) {}rules allow you to change styles such as a bg img when your resolution hits a certain point you should always define the media rules at the bottom of the style sheet so that nothing over rides it
