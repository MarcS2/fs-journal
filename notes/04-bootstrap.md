# Bootstrap

Containers are always the parent element in BS
rows parent the column ie Container < row < column
each row has 12 units of space in the grid if you go over 12 the columns stack
all rows are default display flex;
-Don't have to use all 12 units in the row
don't add x axis margin on columns pushes sides of site outside of the 12 units
flex behaviors require unit space the be able to move around
breakpoints are for making your website look better for smaller devices
