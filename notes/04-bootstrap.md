# Bootstrap

Containers are always the parent element in BS
rows parent the column ie Container < row < column
each row has 12 units of space in the grid if you go over 12 the columns stack
all rows are default display flex;
-Don't have to use all 12 units in the row
don't add x axis margin on columns pushes sides of site outside of the 12 units
flex behaviors require unit space the be able to move around
