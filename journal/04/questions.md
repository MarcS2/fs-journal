# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | synchronous code runs in sequential order and things must happen one after another this can cause blocking and slow down the entire process. asynchronous code doesn't have to only run in a sequential order so you can get around blocking |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | an event listener is used to wait for specific events to happen then calls the function that is provided |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | it stands for representational state transfer it is a principle followed when creating APIs it means that the server will send over a representation of the state of the data in the database |

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | A higher order function is a function that takes in one or many functions as arguments and returns a function. a callback function is excusable code that is passed as an arg to another piece of code that will execute that code |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise is like an actual promise its an object that represents weather a promise was fulfilled or rejected based on task its told to carry out. To capture an error you use the
   .catch() method |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | Get, Put, Post |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application Programming Interface |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | put async in front of the function then a try catch with the await promise inside the try |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | encapsulations in programming helps with security, abstraction and overall data hiding it also helps your better organize your code and write more scalable and maintainable code. |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | bad request |
