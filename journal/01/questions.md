01. In your own words, why do we use Git?

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | specificity is a numerical value given to selectors that creates a sort of importance that makes the property of that selector applied as long as it's not being changed by a different selector with higher weight. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | If you are working with a team or comeback to a project where the !important feature has been utilized it can limit you from making edits to the page because the !important feature is just over ruling the new code  |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```

    > | Selector, Project,Value |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | You convey professionalism as well as make the users feel more inclined to trust the website |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | You wireframe to get a basic idea of the page in mind so that laying out the code is a little more origanized  |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > |  I believe that they can be worth making. They don't have to be perfect and when taking on bigger projects it can help keep you on task |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | when used on an element display flex turns that element into a flex box and the child elements are turned into flex items   |
